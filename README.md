# custom-sync-interval
A tiny Thunderbird addon to easily change the synchronization interval of remote calendars in Lightning Calendar.
This addon is also listed in the official [Thunderbird addons website](https://addons.thunderbird.net/EN-us/thunderbird/addon/custom-sync-interval/).

This addon creates an additional entry in the properties dialog for Lightning calendars (Right click on calendar -> Properties)
that allows to specify a custom interval in which the calendar will be synchronized with the cloud.
